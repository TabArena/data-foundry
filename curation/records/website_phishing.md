## Comments

Clean canonical entry bootstrapped from the TabArena curation workbook ('Tabular' row). Shipped in TabArena (v0.1) / BeyondArena.

TabArena curation verdict: Tabular.

Only 9 features, done differently nowadays

Lennart: Unsure as this seems to be older than other datasets and am missing domain knoweldge how it is doen nowadays

Andrej: Following logic of other, more extensive phishing websites task (10.24432/C51W2X)

**Assessment (AI, 2026-10-14):** no leak in the audit's sense, but the Suspicious class (103 sites) is the donors' judgement of the same nine signals (UCI 379), not an outcome: LightGBM separates it from the rest with AUC 0.987, a depth-6 tree with 0.942. Phishy against Legitimate, from the source lists, scores 0.973 without those rows. Under the documented coding (1/0/-1 = legitimate/suspicious/phishy), 7 of the 9 features point opposite to the label (91% of Phishy sites have SFH rated legitimate), and having_IP_Address takes only 0 and 1, so the definition's renaming of the codes misleads.

CC (2026-10-14, Lennart): Binary, Phishy against Legitimate: the Suspicious class is the donors' judgement of the same signals. Raw feature codes kept.

CC (2026-10-14, Lennart): Accept `dataset_pure_feature_value` (all 167 sites with popUpWidnow = 1 are phishing): the same reversed coding as the other signals, a page property, not a leak.

**Assessment (AI, 2026-10-21):** Metric declared under MET-1..13: fallback roc_auc — Abdelhamid, Ayesh & Thabtah 2014 score 3-class accuracy; our task is binary (suspicious class dropped) and no costs are fixed.

CC (2026-10-27, Lennart): marker Selection Bias, from the AI review of PR #16: phishing sites come from the PhishTank archive and legitimate ones from Yahoo and starting-point directories, two lists collected apart (the definition's fit_reason says so), not the sites a filter meets.

**Assessment (AI, 2026-10-30):** Dtype review (branch ordinal-and-censored-levels; the column decisions with their codebook evidence are on the review board): 6 ordinal scales typed as ordered categories in the codebook's order (CLEAN-14, amended): `popUpWidnow`, `SSLfinal_State`, `Request_URL`, `URL_of_Anchor`, `web_traffic`, `URL_Length` (the README lists their levels); left unordered: `SFH` (low confidence).

CC (2026-10-31, Lennart): marks on the review board of PR #37: SFH ordered with the suspicious 0 in the middle; which end is phishy noted from the features alone (no label).

**Assessment (AI, 2026-10-31):** better data: the data-scouting run of 2026-10-30/31 found better data for the same task: `web_page_phishing_detection` (TBD -> Yes, priority 2), `phishing_websites_vrbancic` (TBD -> 2nd Tier, priority 2). Each is screened in its own record; this record's verdict stays the curator's.

## Review

**Outcome:** added. A question on `CrossSectional` (2026-11-13) was withdrawn when the prototype was dropped.

**Main points:** Nothing open: issue 1 was withdrawn on 2026-11-13.

**Issues for Andrej:**

1. **`CrossSectional` instead of `ForcedIIDFromTemporal`?**

   * **Problem:**
     - The definition is tagged `ForcedIIDFromTemporal`, a forward use case whose time was lost[^fo-1].
     - The target is a present state measured with the features: whether the page is a phishing page, read from the page as it stands, and the use case reads it for new units at their own present[^cs-1].
     - The tag alone changes: the split stays random.
   * **Options:**

     | | Option | What it does | Pro | Con |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | A | Stay `ForcedIIDFromTemporal` (implemented) | the tag and its line stay | the decision stands | the tag claims a forecast the use case does not make |
     | B | `CrossSectional` | the tag and a `Time basis:` line naming the present state, the untested drift for later units and what a dated release would show | names the use case; no claim of a lost forward split | a new prototype on a decided tag |

   * **Recommendation:** B. **Decision:** A or B?

   **Notes for the AI:** on B, swap the tag, write the line, add a CC line; the split does not change.

   [^cs-1]: **SPLIT-32** (Should, 2026-11-13): a target measured together with the features, which the use case reads for new units at their own present, is `CrossSectional`, whether the dates survive or not; its line says whether the drift of the relation was measured or is untested. A label that only arrives later is no present state.
   [^fo-1]: **SPLIT-8** (Must): a forward use case without usable time ships in the closest regime, tagged forced from temporal, with a `Time basis:` line naming the reason.

   **Resolved (2026-11-13, Andrej):** withdrawn: `CrossSectional` was dropped the same day (it named no split the existing prototypes do not give: a present state used later is forced or a measured `StationaryRelation`, used within the covered time `Retrospective`). The tag stays.
