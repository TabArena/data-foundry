## Comments

Consists of 4 datasets with similar features and low value counts depending on how it is used. Need to figure out how to use it. Otherwise, nothing speaks against using them in the benchmark

We take all datasets from this repo as they all represent real tasks. We use the binary classification version of the datasets and the processed files.

Too few samples, is few-shot
