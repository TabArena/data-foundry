## Comments

Clean canonical entry bootstrapped from the TabArena curation workbook ('Tabular' row). Shipped in TabArena (v0.1) / BeyondArena.

TabArena curation verdict: Tabular.

recent and likely still useful predictive task but I am missing domain knowledge

 Talent uses UCI version. Initially, custom train/test split. Task: Predict critical temperature. Might require some special split based on molecules.Paper uses a random split 2/3 - but might be wrong. Data was preprocessed already. Moreover, there is an additional file with information about the molecules.

Potential issue: -

Lennart: No objection

Andrej: But need to check for leaks after obtaining results due to split & preprocessing.
