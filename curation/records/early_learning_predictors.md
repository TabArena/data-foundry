## Comments

Very nice dataset. It was used in a Zindi challenge, where an additional focus next to predictive performance was on interpretability. I think they used random splits, but it should be either temporal or group based (by school). Needs some preprocessing since it doesn't make sense to use all ~1200 features. But we can follow the Zindi challenge, where a subset of features was provided

predict whether a child thrives by five
