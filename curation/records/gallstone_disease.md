## Comments

looks good

CC (2026-10-06, Lennart): Kept after the task-probe review: the `no_spread` flag does not hold. The three untuned families differ by 0.036 in skill (+0.683 to +0.719), which the probe compared, unpaired, with twice their typical standard error over 5 splits (0.054). Tuned methods spread clearly: on BeyondArena TabPFN-3.5 reaches ROC AUC 0.911 and the median method 0.883, with 8 of 29 methods tied with the best.

**Assessment (AI, 2026-10-21):** Metric declared under MET-1..13: fallback roc_auc — Esen et al. 2024 report accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and AUC side by side, none named as the criterion (MET-5).
